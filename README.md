# Anselmos Pelican Blog

This is a [Pelican!](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) Blogging example made with pelican-quickstarter.

I'll be extending it's default capabilities to create ultimate "startup" blogging example for pelican.


# Features that are already included/developed by me:

- FTP uploader with ftputils and netrc file.


# TODO:

- Add theme that will be a responsive one - or create one for my-own

- Add all pelican-plugins required by theme.

- Add [fancy-box](http://fancybox.net/) to theme if other image-viewer is not included.
